<h2>Password Generator<h2>
  
<p>I decided to create this and, I haven't thought it's gonna be hard, but I stayed all morning and part of the afternoon doing this. The result is incredible. It was too vague that I needed to remake the <kbd>JavaScript</kbd> code more than two times.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>In this application, we have a field where you can put the number of characters of ur password and above this, u can select on the checkbox what you want in this "mot de passe": number, low and uppercase or symbols, I think it's not too secure, but when I improve my<kbd>TypeScript</kbd>I'll do this again using that to prevent some errors like those I had. Without further ado, I'll upload the gif showing how it going on</p>
